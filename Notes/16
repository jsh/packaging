I start another run at building the package.

The instructions design the build to fail, to help understand common errors,
but the first error I hit isn't in the instructions: the tarball still has the wrong name.

Instead of 
../tutorial/hithere_1.0.tar.gz
it needs to be called
../tutorial/hithere_1.0.orig.tar.gz

Renaming it gets the advertised error message.
