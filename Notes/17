Install the package? Just build it, then run "dpgk -i *.deb". After this, running the command works fine.

dpkg -r hithere blows it away again.

Add all the generated files to .gitignore, then clean up with "git clean -dfx"

Now what?  Well, probably look at Jeremy's pointer to see what it does that I haven't done. First, though, I think I'll peruse the rest of the documentation here:

https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging

This quickly leads me down an interesting little cul-de-sac:

https://wiki.debian.org/CreateDummyPackage

This leads me through the creation and installation of an entirely empty package with a new tool, equivs (which is actually equivs-control, which generates a dummy control file, and equivs-build, which builds the .deb package after a few things are filled in.)

At this point, I can install the package with dpkg -i, show its contents with apt-cache show, and remove it again with apt-get remove.

To install it with apt-get install, I'll need to create a local repo. That should be fun, but I can't do that now. Time to commit and release, and leave that for another hour.
