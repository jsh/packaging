Might as well take notes. If it turns into work, I can bootstrap them into a talk.

I haven't used the netbook in a while so I update packages and google a bit while I wait.

This looks like a nice tutorial.

Okay, half an hour and I've done package updates, created a repo on GitHub, cloned it, and cranked up gitflow for a work-flow.

Now what?  I clone the repo Jeremy pointed at, ignore it (don't want to change it, and GitHub's already keeping the original), and start through the Debian tutorial.  And get more coffee.
